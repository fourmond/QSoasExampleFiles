[QSoas](https://github.com/fourmond/QSoas). Some of the files are
experiments that were performed in
[Marseille](https://bip.cnrs.fr/groups/bip06/), some other are
synthetic data.

## Data from publications

However, some of the files here come from publications, and are
provided in an effort to help other researchers learn to analyze the
data as was done in the original publications.
