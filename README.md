# QSoasExampleFiles

This repository contains the example files for
[QSoas](https://github.com/fourmond/QSoas). Some of the files are
experiments that were performed in
[Marseille](https://bip.cnrs.fr/groups/bip06/), some other are
synthetic data.

## Data from publications

However, some of the files here come from publications, and are
provided in an effort to help other researchers learn to analyze the
data as was done in the original publications.

 * The contents of the `Joliot` directory was contributed by Frauke
   Baymann, and is taken from
   [Baymann and Rappaport, Biochemistry 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi980963z). The
   data processing is described in the
   [tutorial](https://bip.cnrs.fr/groups/bip06/software/tutorial/#tuto-joliot).
 * The data present in the `Domnik-2017` directory
   were initially acquired for the publication
   [Domnik et al, *Angewandte Chemie*, **2017**](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201709261),
   in which they are used to determine the Michaelis Menten of a CO
   dehydrogenas. The data analysis is described in
   [this post](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2020/09/tutorial-analyze-km-data-of-codhs.html).
 * The data present in the `Jacques-2014` directory were initially
   acquired for the publication
   [Jacques et al, *BBA*, **2014**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2014.05.357).
   How to analyze them is described in
   [this post](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2021/05/tutorial-analyze-redox.html).

## Tips and tricks

 * The files in `Tips-and-Tricks-01` are used as examples to describe
   how to
   [generate smooth fit data from datasets with small number of points](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2020/10/qsoas-tips-and-tricks-generating-smooth.html).
 * The files in `Tips-and-Tricks-02` demonstrate the use of meta to
   extract a series of peaks and
   [plot them as a function of meta-data](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2020/11/qsoas-tips-and-tricks-using-meta-data.html).
 

## Quiz

 * The directory `Quiz-01` contains the data files for
   [the first QSoas quiz](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2020/10/qsoas-quiz-1-averaging-spectra.html),
   and also the [solution](https://vince-debian.blogspot.com/2020/11/solution-for-qsoas-quiz-1-averaging.html).
